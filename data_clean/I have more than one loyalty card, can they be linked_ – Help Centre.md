I have more than one loyalty card, can they be linked?

We're excited to ensure you get the most out of your Rewards For Life! If you think you may have two accounts, don't worry—we can link them seamlessly for you.

**Automatic Linking**: If the details on both accounts match, we'll automatically link them. You can check this in your online account—just log in and go to the Rewards For Life section of your account to view your cards. If you see two card numbers, don't worry! This means the cards are linked and you can use either to collect the same points and vouchers.

**Different Details? No Problem!**: If the information on each card differs, please [r](/hc/en-gb/articles/360016953339)each out to us: **[Contact us](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)**. We're here to help and will make sure everything is connected so you can enjoy all your rewards effortlessly.
