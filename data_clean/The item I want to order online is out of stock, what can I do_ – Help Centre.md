The item I want to order online is out of stock, what can I do?
## Stay Updated on Stock Availability
We're really sorry if an item you wish to order is currently out of stock online.

While we can't provide a specific date for when the product will be restocked, you can click the 'Email me when available' button on the product page. This will open a box where you can enter your email address. Once you've done that, just click the 'Create alert' button to get a notification as soon as the item is back in stock online.

In the meantime, if you need to, you can still check the stock availability for the item in a store. You can find out how to do that here: [How do I check stock in store?](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/19915780888722-How-do-I-check-stock-in-store)
