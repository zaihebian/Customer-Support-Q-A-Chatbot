# Can I contact a Holland & Barrett store directly?

Can I contact a Holland & Barrett store directly?

To make sure every customer gets quick and consistent support, our stores don’t have public phone lines, and we’re not able to share individual store numbers. All calls come through to customer service, who will be able to help with any query you may have.

We’ve got some links below with our most popular store FAQs:

* **Store location or Opening hours:** <https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/stores/>
* **Stock availability:** [**How do I check stock in store?**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/19915780888722-How-do-I-check-stock-in-store)
* **Click & Collect:** <https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/info/delivery-and-returns/click-collect/>
* **Store feedback:** [**Contact us**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us)

We can contact the store on your behalf if needed, and we’ll make sure you get the right information, quickly.
## Why can't I call the store myself?
There are a few reasons:

1. We want every customer to have the same experience, whether they’re shopping in-store or online.
2. Store teams are focused on helping customers face-to-face, so they don’t have the setup to take calls.
3. Most queries can be resolved faster by our Customer Service Team, who have access to systems and processes that store colleagues don’t.
## What number is shown on the Store Locator?
If you’ve spotted a phone number on our Store Locator page, it’s our **Customer Service contact number**. This connects you to our team, not the store itself.
