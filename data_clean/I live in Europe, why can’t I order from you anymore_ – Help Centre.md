I live in Europe, why can’t I order from you anymore?

We have paused delivery to Europe for now but hope to resume EU shipping in the future.

We are very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and we’re working hard to get this service available again soon!

Please keep an eye on our website for further information on international delivery: <https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/info/delivery-and-returns/international-delivery/>
