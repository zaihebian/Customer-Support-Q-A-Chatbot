I live in Ireland, why can’t I order some products from you anymore?

All orders are now shipped from the UK, which means we have to comply with customs regulations and, therefore some items are no longer available to sell to customers in Ireland. We're sorry for any disappointment caused.

If you would like help deciding on an alternative, please [Contact us](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)
