2. Click ‘Apply’, and your savings will show up in the order summary.
3. When you're ready, continue to checkout.
## Just a quick note on using discount codes:
You can only use one discount code per order – they can’t be stacked.

Good news though, you *can* use a Rewards for Life voucher alongside your discount code.

Some exclusions may apply, so it’s always worth checking the [terms and conditions](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/info/terms-and-conditions/promotional-terms/) to see what’s included.
