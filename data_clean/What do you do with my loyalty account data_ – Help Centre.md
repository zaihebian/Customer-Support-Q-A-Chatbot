What do you do with my loyalty account data?

Your privacy is very important to us.

We take great care with any personal information you share with us and will never release these details to any company outside of the Holland & Barrett International group of companies.

We use the information you share with us to keep you up to date with the range of products and services we offer and to help make shopping with us easier. This includes news of events, promotions, offers, product launches, and special activity relating to your Rewards for Life account.

Depending on your marketing preferences, we may get in touch by email, post, text message, or landline.

We are constantly looking to improve our business and the service we offer so from time to time we may contact you to get your feedback or for research purposes. However, we will always give you the option of how you want to be contacted and if you do not wish to be contacted by us, we will respect this.
