How do I return an item - Ireland?

If you want to return or exchange within 30 days of receiving the item, then It’s FREE and easy to do so you have a couple of options.

#### **In-store Return:**

If you wish to return your item(s) at one of our stores, please bring along your receipt if purchased in-store or your order dispatch email, either on your device or printed out, for web orders. A member of staff will be happy to help issue a refund or exchange.

All refunds must be processed using the same payment method you used for your initial purchase. If, for any reason, you no longer have access to the original payment method, we will be pleased to provide you with an exchange or issue a credit note.
