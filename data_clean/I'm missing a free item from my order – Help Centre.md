I'm missing a free item from my order
## Missing a promotional item from your order? Here’s what to check:
We run lots of great mix & match offers, but sometimes it’s easy to miss a step when adding items to your basket. Here's how our most popular promotions work, and what to do if something hasn’t arrived as expected.
## Buy One Get One Free (BOGOF):
For this offer, you’ll need to **add the exact quantity you want to receive**. For example, if you add 2 items to your basket, you’ll receive both, one will be free. If you only add 1, you’ll only receive 1 (and won’t get the second free item). You can mix and match across BOGOF products, and the cheapest item will be free automatically in your basket.
## 3 for 2:
To get this offer, make sure you're adding 3 qualifying items to your basket. These can be all the same or a mix, just make sure they’re included in the 3 for 2 deal. The lowest-priced item will be free and shown in your basket before payment.
## Buy One Get One Half Price (BOGOHP):
Add 2 qualifying items to your basket, and we’ll automatically make the cheapest one half price. You can mix and match across products in the same offer, just make sure you're adding the exact quantity to the basket that you want to receive.
