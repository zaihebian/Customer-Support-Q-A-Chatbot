I want to add an item to my order, how do I do this?

We aim to dispatch orders promptly after they’ve been placed. Because of this, we’re unable to make changes once your order is received. This includes adjustments to the delivery address, email address, cancelling the order after 30 minutes, or adding/removing items.
