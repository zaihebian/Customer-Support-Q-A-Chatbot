How do I use a store credit note/voucher?

A store credit voucher can be used in any of our stores and is valid for 6 months from the date of issue, giving you plenty of time to use it. The expiry date will be shown on the credit voucher.

A store credit voucher looks similar to a receipt. Present it at the till along with your purchase.

If your purchase totals to less than your credit voucher, you'll be issued a new store credit voucher for the remaining balance.
## Important notice:** If your store credit voucher is lost or has expired, we cannot reissue the voucher, so please keep this safe. **Store credit vouchers can't be used online.
