My Rewards for Life card isn't showing on my online account

If you already have a Rewards for Life card and sign up for an online account, your card will be automatically added if the email addresses on your card and the online account match.

If you can't see your Rewards for Life card, or you're seeing a different card number we can fix that for you. You won't be able to add the card details yourself, so please [**contact us**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us)**,** and we will be able to add your Rewards for Life card to your online account.
