Why have my Rewards For Life points disappeared?

Your Points are Turning into Rewards!

Don't worry if your points balance seems lower than before â€“ we're likely converting them into vouchers for you.

During this conversion process, your points balance resets as we transform them into money-off vouchers. This can take a few days and happens at the end of January, April, July and October.

**What to Expect:** You'll soon see your money-off vouchers in your online account. We'll also send them to you via email or post (depending on your selected communication method) in February, May, August, and November.

Your rewards are on their way to treat yourself to your favourite products!
