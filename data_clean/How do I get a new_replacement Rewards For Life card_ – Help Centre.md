How do I get a new/replacement Rewards For Life card?

To help reduce plastic waste, we went card-less in April 2023. We no longer offer physical cards, but don't worry, if you've misplaced your card, you can still enjoy all the fantastic benefits of Rewards For Life. Just download our APP and create an online account (if you haven't already).

Your card will link automatically if the email on your rewards for life card matches your online account. If they don't match, no problem - just reach out to our friendly customer service team **[here](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us)**, and we'll sort it out for you.

With our APP, you'll have instant access to your points balance and any vouchers you may have.

Plus, you can easily scan the QR code in-store to collect points and even add your Rewards For Life card to your Apple or Android wallet for extra convenience.
