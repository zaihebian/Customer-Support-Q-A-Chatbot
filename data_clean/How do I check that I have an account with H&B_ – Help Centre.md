How do I check that I have an account with H&B?

We're here to make sure your H&B experience is smooth and enjoyable! Here's how to check if you have an account:
## Log In or Reset Password:
Try logging in or selecting the "Forgotten Password" option on our website. If you don't receive an email, check your junk or spam inbox. If you still don't get an email, try creating a new account.

**Account Linking**:

Remember, Rewards For Life is separate from your online account unless you've signed up online and your card has been linked. You won't automatically be signed up for an online account if you've signed up for Rewards For Life in-store or if you have a Rewards For Life card.

**Need Help?**:

If you still need assistance, please reach out to us [**here**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us)**.** Our friendly and dedicated customer service team is ready to help you with any questions or issues.
