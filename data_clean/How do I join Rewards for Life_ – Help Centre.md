How do I join Rewards for Life?

You can join Rewards for Life instore with the help of our colleagues, or you can sign up yourself online.

To sign up and begin earning rewards, just follow the relevant account creation link below:

* United Kingdom: <https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/auth/signup>
* Republic of Ireland: <https://www.hollandandbarrett.ie/auth/signup>

Once you've entered your details, you'll receive an email verification and your new Rewards for Life digital card will be created and attached to your online account. If you log in to your account online, you can view your points and any available vouchers.

If you'd prefer to sign up in-store, one of our store colleagues will be happy to help. If you sign up in store you'll need to create an online account before you can view your points and any available vouchers. Either way, you'll receive an email when you have new vouchers to spend with us.
## Important:
We no longer issue physical (plastic) *Rewards for Life* cards. Whether you sign up online or in-store, your membership will be digital only.

You can easily add your digital Rewards card to your Apple or Android Wallet for quick access. Just follow the instructions in our Help Centre article: **<https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/19741702168082-How-do-I-add-my-rewards-card-to-my-Apple-or-Android-wallet>**

With a Rewards for Life account, every pound you spend with us earns you 4 points, 100 points equals to £1.00/€1.00.

You'll be given 300 bonus points when you sign up to Rewards for Life which will be available to spend when your first voucher is made available. You'll receive 4 vouchers a year, as long as you have over 50 points. Vouchers are made available in February, May, August and November.
