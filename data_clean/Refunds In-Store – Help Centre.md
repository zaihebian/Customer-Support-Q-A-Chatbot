Refunds In-Store

You can return any unused item within 30 days of your original purchase date for an exchange or refund in store, as long as it is unopened, unused, in a saleable condition, and the seals remain intact. Please bring the original receipt or order confirmation with you.

**Exclusions:** Medicines, food, and cosmetic products that have been opened cannot be refunded or exchanged unless they are faulty.

All refunds must be processed using the same payment method you used for your initial purchase.

The store will need your physical card to process the refund. If, for any reason, you no longer have access to the original payment method, we will be pleased to provide you with an exchange or issue a credit note.

**Important:** If you have placed an order while in store with help from one of our colleagues, you will need to return to the same store for any refund on the order.
