How can I view my Rewards For Life points?

If your Rewards For Life number is linked to your online account (My H&B), you can easily log into your account and check your points anytime under the Rewards For Life section:

If you don't have an online account you can easily create one [**here.**](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/auth/signup) If the email address linked to your Rewards For Life card is the same as the email you sign up with it will link the accounts automatically.

If the email addresses don’t match, don’t worry. Just reach out to us [**here**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us), and we'll link the accounts for you.
