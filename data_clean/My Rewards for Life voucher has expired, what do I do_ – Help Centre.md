## Make the Most of Your Vouchers.
All money-off vouchers come with a 3-month use-by date from the date of issue, as outlined in the emails or postal mailer you received.

If you have a voucher that's expired within the last year, we can manually extend it for you so you have an extra month to spend it in-store or online.

If you need assistance with an expired voucher or have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch [**here**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us). We're here to help!
