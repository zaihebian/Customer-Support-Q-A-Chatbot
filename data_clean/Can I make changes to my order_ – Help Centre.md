# Can I make changes to my order?

Can I make changes to my order?

Once an order’s been placed, there’s only a short window where we can make changes, so here’s what’s possible:

We **can**:

* Update the delivery address, but only within 30 minutes of placing your order
* Cancel the order, only within the first 30 minutes

We **can’t**:

* Change the email or billing address
* Update the payment method
* Add or remove items from your order
* Stop the order from being delivered past **30 minutes** of it being placed
* Change the order on the address past **30 minutes** of it being placed

If you’ve just placed your order and need to cancel it, you may still be able to do this using the form below, as long as it’s within the **30-minute window**:

Missed the window? Don’t worry, you can still return your order completely free of charge.

You’ll find all the details on how to return right here:
