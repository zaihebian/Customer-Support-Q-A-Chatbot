## Check Stock in Store with Ease
To check stock in store, find the item you want online, click on 'store availability,' enter your postcode, town, or city, and it will display the local stores that have the item in stock.

If you're having trouble locating the item you want online, it may be that the item has been discontinued.

**Please note:** You won't be able to get in touch with the store directly, but our customer service team can help with any stock or in-store queries.
