Can I collect points if I don't have my card with me when purchasing?

You can collect points in-store with our digital only Rewards for Life cards.

When shopping in-store, we can easily find your account at our tills using your email address or postcode.

**Have the app downloaded?**You can also scan your card in-store using the Holland & Barrett app, if you have an account online with us, you can use the QR code provided in the app to scan your card at the till for any of your purchases.

You can also add your card to your Apple or Android wallet on your phone, which we have an article for here: **<https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/19741702168082-How-do-I-add-my-rewards-card-to-my-Apple-or-Android-wallet>**
## Forgot Your Card? No Problem**: If you forget to use your card when making a purchase, just keep your receipt. You can ask for the points to be added during your next visit to your local store. Alternatively, you can contact our customer service team, and we'll be happy to add the points for you. **[Contact Us.](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)
You have 4 weeks to reclaim lost points from a previous purchase, as long as you have your receipt.
