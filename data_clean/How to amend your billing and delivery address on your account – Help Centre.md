How to amend your billing and delivery address on your account
## *Please note:***Changing your address will not affect existing orders. Once an order is placed, an address cannot be changed. If you require further help with existing orders, please [**Contact us**](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)**.
To change an address on your account, start by visiting our website and [**sign in**](https://auth.hollandandbarrett.com/u/login?state=hKFo2SAzTlhxVjVfdkdWY3dMRVA0T1p1ZUJXbGpPQUJFanY1aKFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIDJiZ0tQZ0hDcmx0MkZnRTF5cDk3STBteTRWYzVROWRpo2NpZNkgSmwzRWF2a010RDNpcjhLOTNSTlM4TldBVVFKcks4bnI).

Next click on "**My H&B**", and then under "**Account details & settings**" click "**My Saved Addresses**" (as below).

Alternatively, if you're logged in, you can simply click on this link <https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/my-account/addresses> to head directly to your address section.

Here, you can view your **saved addresses**. Your Primary Address will be displayed at the top, and any other saved addresses will appear below it.

You have the options to edit, delete, or set an address as your primary address.

It's a good idea to remove any old addresses that you no longer use as well as any duplicate addresses too.

You can add more than one address to your account. Just be sure to check you have selected and saved the correct primary address.

***Important notice:*** If you have a subscription with us, you will also need to edit the address on your subscription as well, as it won't update automatically once the address in your Account Settings has been changed. You can find out more about changing the address on your subscription here: [How do I make changes to my subscription?](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360016910680-How-do-I-make-changes-to-my-subscription)
