Checking out with PayPal

If you use PayPal as your selected payment method please ensure the address on your PayPal account is accurate to prevent your order being delivered to an old or incorrect address.

**PayPal Express**: When you use PayPal Express, the address that gets selected isn't always taken from your saved addresses in your PayPal account.

PayPal keeps track of every delivery address you've used in the past, including all Click & Collect addresses. So, when you choose PayPal Express, it may sometimes default to one of your recently used addresses instead. Please make sure to double check this when using PayPal Express to prevent your order being delivered to an old or incorrect address.
