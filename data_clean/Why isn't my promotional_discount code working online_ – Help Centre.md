Why isn't my promotional/discount code working online?

If your promotional code isn't working for your online order, there could be a few reasons for this. The options below might help you understand the issue.
## Rewards For Life voucher:
To use your Rewards For Life voucher online, please ensure the following:

1. In the basket page, enter your Rewards For Life number first. It will display 'You will collect x amount of points' if successfully applied. The Rewards For Life voucher won’t apply if the card number is not entered.
2. If you're logged in and your Rewards For Life is linked to your online account, this should apply automatically. You can find your voucher number in the Rewards For Life section of your 'My H&B' online account if the voucher hasn't applied automatically.
3. After confirming your Rewards For Life number, enter the voucher number in the 'Discount codes & offers' section of the basket page in the 'Enter a promotional code' box.

## Discount code:
To use a Discount Code online, please ensure the following:

1. Enter the code in the 'Discount Codes & Offers' section in the basket page in the 'Enter a promotional code' box.
2. Make sure to check the T&Cs for item eligibility: [**https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/info/redeem-in-store/**](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/info/redeem-in-store/) Some individual items will state ‘Discount codes cannot be used with this product’ so please look out for this on the item page or it will be displayed in the basket page.
3. Some discount codes are App exclusive, this means they can only be used on the App and not on the website.
4. All discount codes have an expiry date, so make sure to double check your code hasn't expired.
5. Some discount codes require a minimum spend, so please ensure you meet this requirement. If you've used a Rewards For Life voucher or if the items you've ordered are part of a different promotion that reduces your total, you may need to add more items to reach the minimum spend.
## Please be aware discount codes cannot be stacked, only one discount code can be used at a time.
