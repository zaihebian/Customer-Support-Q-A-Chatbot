# Paper Bag Charge

Paper Bag Charge

At Holland & Barrett, we care deeply about our planet and the people on it. That’s why we’re always looking for ways to reduce waste and encourage more sustainable choices.

One small step we’ve taken is to charge £0.25 for each paper bag. We know it might feel like just a bag, but this small charge makes a big difference. Here’s why:

* **It helps the planet**: Paper bags are recyclable, but they still take energy and resources to produce. Charging for them encourages reuse and helps reduce the use of single-use packaging.
* **It encourages change**: When people bring their own bags, we all win. It’s a simple habit that’s better for the environment, and your pocket.
* **It supports our sustainability goals**: Every choice we make adds up. This charge is part of our bigger plan to reduce our environmental impact and move towards a more sustainable future.

Of course, if you ever forget your bag, we’ve got you covered with our paper ones (that are made from 100% recycled paper). But we’d love it if you could bring your own where possible.

Thanks for helping us make better choices together.
