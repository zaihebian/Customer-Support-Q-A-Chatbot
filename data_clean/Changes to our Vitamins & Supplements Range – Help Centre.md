# Changes to our Vitamins & Supplements Range

Changes to our Vitamins & Supplements Range

From the 14th of August 2024 we’re refreshing our vitamins & supplements range. Over the next 12 months you'll see a more modern and appealing packaging with clearer, colour coded information so you can shop with confidence. We know colour blindness affects people in different ways, so we're using white text on green background to ensure legibility for all nutritional and ingredient information.

Our Vitamins and Supplements range is undergoing a complete review. We'll be introducing some brand-new products, discontinuing a few, and reformulating and repackaging many others. This product makeover will help organise our stores clearly and help you find the right products with ease.

Some products will only be available online and will no longer be available to purchase in store. Don’t worry, if you prefer to shop in store our colleagues will be able to place an order for you that you can collect from store.

## Will my subscription be affected?
Where possible we will automatically swap your subscribed product for the updated version, so you don't need to do anything at all. We’ll let you know about this via email, so you're kept up to date with any changes made.

If your subscribed product has changed or discontinued, we won't just swap to an alternative. We'll let you know via email that your subscription is cancelling, and if appropriate, we'll recommend similar items that you can subscribe to instead so that you don’t miss out!

If you do have any questions about this just [contact us](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us) and we'll be happy to help!
