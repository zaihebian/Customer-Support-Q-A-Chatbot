How do I apply my Rewards For Life voucher to my online order? – Help Centre

To apply your Rewards For Life to your order you'll need to sign into your online account or create an account with the same email you used to register the Rewards For Life with.

In the basket page on the website just above the checkout button you'll see the amount of points you could collect on the order, here it will prompt you to sign in or create an account if you click on the arrow.

Once you've logged in, this section in the basket page above the checkout button will tell you how many points you will collect, and if any vouchers have already been applied automatically for you.

To redeem your voucher (if it hasn't applied automatically) you'll need to navigate to the 'Discount Codes & Offers' section of the basket page and in the box which states 'Enter a promotional code' you can enter your Rewards For Life voucher number:

**Please note**: You won't be able to collect points or redeem your voucher unless you're logged.

* You can create an account **here**.
