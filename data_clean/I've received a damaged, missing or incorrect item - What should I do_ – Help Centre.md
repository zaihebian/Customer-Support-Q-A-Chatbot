I've received a damaged, missing or incorrect item - What should I do?

We're really sorry there's been a problem with your order.
## A few quick things to check if you think something’s missing from your order:
* **Your order might be arriving in more than one parcel.** You can check this by heading to ‘**My Orders**’ in your online account (on our website or app). If everything’s been dispatched, you can track your parcels here: <https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/track-my-order>
* **The item could be out of stock.** Sometimes an item sells out just as your order’s being placed. If that happens, we’ll hold it for 24 hours. If it’s still unavailable after that, we’ll email you and issue a refund. If it comes back in stock, the rest of your order may arrive separately.
* **There may have been a packing error.** If your delivery shows as complete but something’s still missing, we may have made a mistake, we can get that put right for you! Just follow the steps below:

For any missing, damaged or incorrect item queries, fill in the relevant form below with your order details and details of what’s gone wrong. One of our team will review and get it sorted for you, either by sending a replacement or issuing a refund, depending on your preference.

We'll aim to respond within 48 hours.

Once that’s done, we’ll be in touch to confirm and let you know what to expect next.
