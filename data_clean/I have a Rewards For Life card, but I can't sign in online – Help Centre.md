I have a Rewards For Life card, but I can't sign in online

Having trouble signing in online if you have a Rewards For Life card? No worries!

It might be because you don't have an online account yet. If you signed up in-store, you won't automatically have an online account, but you can easily create one [here](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/auth/signup).

Just make sure your details, like your email and full name, match, and we'll link everything for you automatically.

Once you've signed in, you should see your card under the 'Rewards For Life' section of your account. Please allow up to 24 hours for this to appear, if it doesn't straight away.

If you still can't see your card number after 24 hours, reach out to us here: **[Contact us](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)**, and we'll be happy to assist you!
