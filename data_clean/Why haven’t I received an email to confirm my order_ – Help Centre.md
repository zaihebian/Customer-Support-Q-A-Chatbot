Why haven’t I received an email to confirm my order?

We're sorry if you didn't receive a confirmation email after placing your order.

This might happen for a few reasons:

* The email could have ended up in your spam/junk folder.
* Your email address might have been entered incorrectly when you placed the order.
* A technical issue could have prevented your order from reaching our system, resulting in a failure.

You might want to try the following:

* Check your spam/junk inbox.
* Log in to your online account, go to 'My H&B', and click on 'My Orders'. If you can see your order here, it means it has been successfully processed.
* Check the account you used to pay for the order. If you have any 'payments pending', it may indicate a processing error.
* If it’s been over an hour since you placed your order and you haven’t received a confirmation email, it’s likely that your order has not gone through. In this case, the pending transaction will take 5 - 7 working days to clear from your account.

Please keep in mind:

* Pending transactions on your credit or debit card are still held by your bank, not by Holland & Barrett. It’s normal for pending transactions that aren't processed to return to your account within 5 - 7 working days.
* Paypal may hold these funds for up to 21 days before they are returned to your account.
* If you have any questions about pending transactions on your credit/debit card or Paypal account, please reach out to your account provider directly.
