# Why Has My Honey Crystallised?

Why Has My Honey Crystallised?

If your honey looks a bit grainy or solid, don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal. Crystallisation is a natural process and doesn’t mean the honey’s gone off or is faulty in any way.
## Can I Still Use It?
Absolutely. Crystallised honey is still just as safe and delicious to enjoy. There’s no need to return it.

You can easily turn it back to liquid form with gentle warming.
## How to Re-liquefy Crystallised Honey:
1. Place the jar (glass or plastic, not metal) into a bowl or pan of warm water.
2. Warm the water slowly on a low heat – it should be warm, not boiling (around 35°C / 95°F).
3. Leave the jar in the water for 20–30 minutes, stirring now and then to help the crystals dissolve.
4. Avoid heating above 43°C / 110°F, as this can affect the honey’s flavour and natural benefits.
