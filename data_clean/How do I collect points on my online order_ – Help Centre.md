How do I collect points on my online order?

To apply your Rewards For Life to your order you'll need to sign into your online account or create an account with the same email you used to register the Rewards For Life with.

In the basket page on the website just above the checkout button you'll see the amount of points you could collect on the order, here it will prompt you to sign in or create an account if you click on the arrow.

Once you've logged in, this section in the basket page above the checkout button will tell you how many points you will collect, and if any vouchers have already been applied automatically for you.

If you've placed an order and you haven't collected your points you won't be able to add the points to your account yourself so please get in touch with us [**here**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us) so we can do this for you!
