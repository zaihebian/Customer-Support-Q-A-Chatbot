How do I return an item - UK?

If you want to return or exchange within 30 days of receiving the item, then It’s FREE and easy to do so you have a couple of options.

#### **In-store Return:**

If you wish to return your item(s) at one of our stores, please ensure you bring your receipt or an alternative proof of purchase.

For web orders, please bring along your order dispatch email, either on your device or printed out. Our team members will assist you in processing a refund or exchange.

All refunds must be processed using the same payment method you used for your initial purchase. If, for any reason, you no longer have access to the original payment method, we will be pleased to provide you with an exchange or issue a credit note.

**Important -** If you have purchased items in a store known as a web-in-store order, this is when an order is created online within the store, you will need to return to the store to get a refund.

For orders placed on the website if you can’t visit your local store you can return via post, here's how.

#### **H&B.com orders:**
