What do I do if I lose or break my reward card?

No need to worry! We no longer issue physical cards, but you can easily access your digital card and everything you need in our App or online.

If you've already signed up for an online account, your Rewards For Life account should be linked, provided you registered with the same email address. You’ll find your digital card in the Rewards For Life section of your online account. Card not showing in your online account? No problem, just get in touch here: **[Contact us](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)** so we can help.

If you don’t yet have an online account, [**sign up**](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/auth/signup) using the email address you registered with, and we’ll link your card automatically for you.

Prefer not to sign up online? No problem! Just provide your card-linked details (like email, name, and address) to a store colleague, and they can look up your account so you can collect points or redeem vouchers as usual.
