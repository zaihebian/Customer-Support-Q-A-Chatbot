I don't have a printer. How do I print my returns label off?

If you don’t have a printer, we have several printer-free returns options:

You can select

* Evri – At most parcel shops you can print of your label with a QR code that is provided.
* Royal Mail – Use your QR code at your nearest post office where the label will be printed for you.
* InPost Locker – You can drop off at your nearest InPost locker using your QR code.

Alternatively, you can contact our Customer Services Team and we can print this off and send it to you. We just need your order number, delivery postcode and the address you would like the label/QR code sent to. You can contact us here: [Contact us](/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378)

*Important:*

Our Customer Service Team can only print and send a returns label/QR codes for orders placed on hollandandbarrett.com or app for UK locations.
