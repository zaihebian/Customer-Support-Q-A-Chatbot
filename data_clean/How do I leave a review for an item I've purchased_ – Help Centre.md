How do I leave a review for an item I've purchased?
## We’d love to hear what you think!
If you’ve made a purchase online, we’ll send a review invite to the email linked to your order. For in-store purchases, we’ll send it to the email connected to your Rewards for Life account – as long as your card was used during the transaction.

If you’ve previously unsubscribed from review request emails, you won’t receive these emails anymore. Right now, this is the only way to leave a review.
## Want to unsubscribe from review emails?
You can do that anytime by clicking the unsubscribe at the bottom of these emails.
