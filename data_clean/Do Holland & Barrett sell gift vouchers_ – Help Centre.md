Do Holland & Barrett sell gift vouchers?

We're pleased to let you know that we do offer H&B paper gift vouchers in our stores. Just a quick reminder that these can only be redeemed in-store and aren't valid for online purchases.

Additionally, we accept One4all gift cards in our stores, but please keep in mind that they are not valid for online purchases.
