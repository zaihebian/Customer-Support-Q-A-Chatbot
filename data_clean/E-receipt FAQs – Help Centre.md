E-receipt FAQs
## What is an e-receipt?
Exclusive to our Rewards For Life members with an email address associated with their account, an e-receipt is the same as a paper receipt but is emailed to you rather than printed out in store. Stored in your inbox, you'll never need to worry about losing a receipt again!
## How do I get an e-receipt?
When you make a purchase in store linked to your Rewards For Life account, our store colleague will ask you if you wish to receive your receipt via email. No manual input of your email address is required.
## How long does it take the e-receipt to land in my inbox?
As soon as the purchase is completed, the e-receipt will be processed instantly. This is dependent on your access to Wi-Fi/mobile data to access your receipt.
## Can I opt out of receiving e-receipts?
The e-receipt is a transactional email, so there is no unsubscribe functionality included or required. However, the e-receipt is requested on a per transaction basis – you will have the choice at the till whether to receive an e-receipt, paper receipt (or both) or no receipt at all.
## My email address was entered incorrectly on my store e-receipt, can I change it?
The e-receipt will be delivered to the email address associated with your Rewards For Life account. If you wish to update your RFL account email address, please contact us and we'll set you up with a new account, also transferring your RFL points and transaction history so you don’t miss out.
## Do e-receipts contain personal information?
The e-receipt will contain your first name as stated in your Rewards For Life account and the list of products purchased, returned or exchanged. Depending on your method of payment, it will also show the last 4 digits of your debit/credit card.
## Can I turn paper receipts into digital receipts?
Paper receipts cannot be sent as e-receipts after the purchase has been completed and the colleague has closed the transaction window. However, you will have the option to receive both a paper receipt and e-receipt for your transaction at the point of purchase if requested.
## Can I get a refund with an e-receipt?
Yes – the returns barcode is included at the bottom of the email, which the store colleague will scan to process your return.
## Can I use e-receipts for VAT purposes?
Yes - E-receipts contain the VAT registration number and breakdown of values.
## Can I request an email gift receipt?
No - Gift receipts are not able to be delivered via email currently.
## Can I use an e-receipt for warranty purposes?
Yes – the e-receipt is your proof of purchase and will be dated and time stamped to determine your return period.
