My orders been delivered to the wrong address, what now?

If you think your parcel has been delivered to the wrong address, here's what you can do.

**Verify Your Address**:

First, double-check your confirmation email to ensure the correct address was provided when you placed your order.

If you used PayPal or Apple Pay, make sure the address linked to these payment methods is accurate.

Also, check the default address selected in your online account to ensure it's up to date. These steps are essential and can help prevent future issues.
## Troubleshooting Steps:
* Delivery Card: Look for a delivery card from one of our couriers with further instructions.
* Check with Neighbors: Your neighbours might have accepted your parcel on your behalf, so please ask them.
* Safe Places: Look in any safe places where the delivery driver might have left your parcel, such as a shed, garage, or porch.
* Delivery Details: Review the courier's delivery image and the GPS location provided in the tracking details.

If after these steps you still can't locate your parcel, don't worry! Reach out to us directly, and we'll ensure you receive the support you need.
