Can I change the address on my order? – Help Centre
## Need to update your delivery address?
If you’ve spotted a mistake with your delivery address, our Customer Service will try to help. If you get in touch via chat or phone within **30 minutes** of placing your order, we’ll make sure your parcel is sent to the right place.
## You'll find our contact details here:** **Contact us – Help Centre
We only have a 30 minute window to change your delivery address so if time is running out you can quickly cancel your order and place it again using the correct address. **Just use the form below to cancel - we can only cancel orders within 30 minutes of them being placed:**

**If you've missed the 30 minute window to change an address or cancel the order, we’re no longer able to make changes or stop the order from being delivered**. That’s because we start processing your order quickly to get ready for dispatch.

If your order is going to the wrong address, here’s a few things you could try:

* **Use your courier’s tracking link** to check if your parcel can be redirected to a suitable pick-up point.
* **Leave instructions** with a reception or concierge, if one is available at the address.
* **Collect from your previous address** if you're in touch with the occupant.

If the parcel can’t be delivered or is rejected, it’ll be returned to us and we’ll refund you in full when it arrives, this can take up to 21 days.
