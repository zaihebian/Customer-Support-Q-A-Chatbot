I've purchased online or in store and my points haven't been added, what do I do?

If you've made a purchase in store or online and your points haven't been added don't worry, our Customer Service Team will be able to help. Just [**Contact Us**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us)and one of our advisors will take care of it to ensure those points are added for you!

Please have your proof of purchase handy, which can be your order number or in store receipt.

Just a little reminder that you won't be able to add points to your account yourself, and our store colleagues won't be able to do that for you either.
