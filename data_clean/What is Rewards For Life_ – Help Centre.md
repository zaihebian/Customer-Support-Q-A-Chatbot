What is Rewards For Life?

Rewards for Life is our loyalty programme that allows us to give back to you.

With Rewards for Life you will collect 4 points for every £1 you spend when you shop at Holland & Barrett, either in store or online.

We’ll turn your points into quarterly money-off vouchers (providing you earn at least 50 points).

And when you join, we’ll give £3 worth of points to get you started!

Signing up online is easy. Simply create an account and click 'Join Rewards For Life'.

Once you’ve signed up and logged in, take a look at the Rewards For Life section in your online account. You can view your points balance, card number, any active or used vouchers and exclusive offers and benefits.

If you're logged in while shopping online you will automatically collect points. If you're shopping in store, simply scan your personal QR code at the till. You can access this by downloading the H&B App. Just sign into the App using the same email address on your online account. If you're unable access the QR code, don't worry, you can provide your details to our colleague at the till and they will apply your points.
## Note:
* You’ll need to earn 50 points to receive a money-off voucher, if you don’t reach 50 points all points will be carried over to the next collecting period.
* Every point you earn is equivalent to money value, for example, 50 points is worth 50p/50 cent and 100 points is worth £1/€1.
* You can expect to see your points converted to vouchers in February, May, August, and November.
* Vouchers expire at the end of the quarter (after 3 months), so be sure to use them for your online or in-store purchases.
