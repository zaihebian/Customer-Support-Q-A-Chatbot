Are dogs allowed in Holland & Barrett stores?

We are unable to allow **non-working animals** into a store to minimise risk to customers and colleagues.

Our stores often have limited space so dogs (or other animals) may cause a trip hazard or pose hygiene and allergy risks.

All assistance dogs, including but not limited to guide dogs, hearing assistance dogs, emotional support dogs, or assistance dogs in training are exempt from this due to the specific needs of the handler.

​​We're sorry for any disappointment caused.
