I've selected the forgotten password option but I haven't received a password reset email

Here are a few things we recommending checking:

1. If you're having trouble logging in, it might help to reset your password first:

* [**UK reset password**](https://auth.hollandandbarrett.com/u/reset-password/request/hb-identities?state=hKFo2SBqWGVUMEM2RTZKRDh6Z29IVVQtRnVKbWJFQUlWbmxwbaFurnJlc2V0LXBhc3N3b3Jko3RpZNkgdnJwUEVvYW9KU3Y1TTdjeHpBRl80VmtSVWtlaW44ZFCjY2lk2SBKbDNFYXZrTXREM2lyOEs5M1JOUzhOV0FVUUpySzhucg)
* [**Ireland reset password**](https://auth.hollandandbarrett.ie/u/reset-password/request/hb-identities?state=hKFo2SAwcFUwNmUtQ3NmRXp1ci0xX055eHJVQUl2akt1RDNDMaFurnJlc2V0LXBhc3N3b3Jko3RpZNkga0FLNzB1ZTNLcEZXLU55TDVLQW9uaXp2RkRUUmN2TUajY2lk2SBnNFBkYXh2VjBJZlBwYlZ5TzRsQUxveFJzQXVuREFBeg)

  2. Double check that you've entered your email address correctly.

  3. Please wait at least 10 minutes for the reset password link to arrive.

  4. Don't forget to check your spam/junk or 'other' inbox, just in case the reset email has ended up there.
## *Important note***: If you have a Rewards For Life account, receive marketing emails, or use your email in-store, it doesn't always mean you have an online account. They are separate until you create an account online, at which point the accounts will be linked. **If you haven't received a reset email, this could be the reason.
Even if you've ordered from us before, you might not have an account since you may have checked out as a guest.

If you're unsure, please try to create an account. If you do have an account, you’ll see the following message 'The email you've used is already registered'.

If you are still encountering issues, please [**get in touch**](https://help.hollandandbarrett.com/hc/en-gb/articles/20011957983378-Contact-us) so we can help!
