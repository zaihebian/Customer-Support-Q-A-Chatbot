How can I spend my rewards?
## How your points are collected
Collect 4 points for every £1/€1 you spend with us. We’ll convert your points into quarterly money-off vouchers as long as you have collected a minimum of 50 points at the end of each collecting period. Any leftover points will go towards your next voucher. Points increase in 25 point increments.
## How to spend your money-off voucher
Every 3 months we'll send you a money-off voucher, these will be emailed or posted (depending on your preferred method of communication) in February, May, August and November.

You can spend your money-off voucher on anything you like in-store, in the App, online, or by phone.

Whether you want to stick to your favourite product or be adventurous and try something new, we'll take the value of your voucher off the cost of your transaction, after all discounts have been applied!

Just make sure that you have your voucher, voucher code, or mobile app to hand. All discount codes should be applied to the basket page under the discount codes & offers section once you are happy with your order summary.

*Notes:*

* Money-off vouchers have to be spent in one transaction and change cannot be given
* Money-off vouchers cannot be used on any subscription repeat orders
* All vouchers need to be used before the expiry date shown
## My voucher is not working online
If your voucher is not working as expected it's a good idea to check the code is correct first of all, and that the voucher has not expired.

You also need to make sure your rewards card is linked to the order, this will be done automatically if you're logged in online. To check go to your basket and click the Rewards for Life section if you don't see a card number type yours into the box and apply before adding the voucher again.
